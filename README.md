# Pok√©mon Dual-Type Matchup Calculator

## üåü About This Project

The **Pok√©mon Dual-Type Matchup Calculator** is a web application designed to help users easily check and analyze the complex type matchups in the Pok√©mon games. It allows for quick understanding of offensive and defensive type advantages and disadvantages for both single-type and dual-type Pok√©mon through an intuitive user interface.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * **All 18 Types Supported**: Includes all official Pok√©mon types.
  * **Offensive Matchup Calculation**: Based on the selected primary type, it shows which types are super effective (2x), not very effective (0.5x), or have no effect (0x) against.
  * **Defensive Matchup Calculation (Single/Dual-Type)**:
      * For a single selected type, it displays weaknesses (2x), resistances (0.5x), and immunities (0x).
      * For dual-types, it calculates and displays precise defensive matchups by multiplying the effectiveness of each type (resulting in 4x, 2x, 0.5x, 0.25x, 0x).
  * **Interactive UI**:
      * **Select First Type**: Click an icon from the "All Types" list to select the first type.
      * **Create Dual-Type**: Drag another type icon from the "All Types" list and drop it onto the "Selected Type Area" to add it as a second type.
      * **Remove Selected Type(s)**:
          * Click a selected type icon in the "Selected Type Area" to remove it.
          * Alternatively, drag a selected type icon from the "Selected Type Area" and drop it anywhere *outside* this area to remove it.
          * If the first type is removed and a second type was present, the second type becomes the first.
      * **Explore from Results**: Click on any type icon shown in the "Attacking" or "Defending" results sections to quickly see its matchups.
  * **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
  * **Web Accessibility**: Basic accessibility features are supported, including keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes for screen readers.
  * **Ad Banner Slots**: Placeholder areas at the top and bottom of the page are included for potential ad integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

  * **HTML5**: Structures the web page.
  * **CSS3**: Styles the application, utilizing the Tailwind CSS framework for a modern and responsive design.
  * **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Implements all dynamic functionalities, including type selection, matchup calculations, and drag-and-drop features, without external libraries.

## üéÆ How to Use

1.  **Select First Type**:
      * Click on a type icon from the "All Types" list with your mouse, or focus on it using your keyboard and press Enter or Space.
      * The selected type will appear in the "Selected Type Area" below, and its offensive/defensive matchups will be displayed at the bottom of the page.
2.  **Select Second Type (for Dual-Type Configuration)**:
      * Drag another type icon from the "All Types" list.
      * Drop the dragged icon onto the "Selected Type Area" where the first type is displayed.
      * Both types will now be shown, and the "Defending" matchups will be updated based on the dual-type calculation.
3.  **Remove Selected Type(s)**:
      * **By Clicking**: Click again on a type icon within the "Selected Type Area" to remove it.
          * If you click to remove the first type while a second type is present, the second type will become the first.
          * If you click to remove the second type, only the second type will be removed.
      * **By Dragging Out**: Drag a type icon from the "Selected Type Area" and drop it anywhere **outside** this designated area to remove it.
          * If the first type is dragged out and a second type was present, the second type becomes the first.
4.  **Explore Further from Results**:
      * Type icons displayed in the "Attacking" or "Defending" results sections are also clickable (or selectable via keyboard).
      * Choosing a type from the results will immediately update the calculator to show matchups for that newly selected type.

## üíª How to Run Locally

1.  Download the `index.html` file (or the HTML file you saved for this project).
2.  Open the downloaded `index.html` file directly in your web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
      * You can usually do this by dragging the file into an open browser window or by right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with" followed by your preferred browser.

## üí° Potential Future Enhancements (Optional)

  * Implement a search function to look up Pok√©mon by name and automatically load their types.
  * Consider the effects of Pok√©mon Abilities on type matchups.
  * Add functionality to calculate the effectiveness of specific Pok√©mon moves (based on move type).
